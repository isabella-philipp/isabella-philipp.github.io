          May serve well as a base to see surrounding places reachable by car, but also by public busses, even though certainly less comfortably.
          <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/WtdW1gB96aENuvy2A">Montañita</a> has great cocktail street bars, sea food, a surfer club and lots of disco — at the expense of the idyll.

        We recommend you to rent a car or van if you plan to do a longer trip around Ecuador. 
        However, if you prefer traveling by bus, you can check the destinations at bus agencies such as <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://reinadelcamino.ec/frecuencias-2/">reinadelcamino.ec</a> or

          The town itself may be quite touristic, but you can do small trips to 7 jaw-dropping waterfalls, mountain bike tours, wild water rafts, and hikes, and or chill in the thermal baths and go out at night.

      <span class="main_text">
        Please be aware that levels of criminality in Ecuador are much higher than in Germany, Austria, Spain etc. 
        Most people are nice and kind (like everywhere except in Germany). 
        However, especially if you do not understand Spanish, it can be difficult to tell apart friend from foe. 
        It is always a good idea to ask at the reception of your stay for directions, ask them for advice and stick to your plans.
        Do not walk outside in the dark. 
        Avoid walking alone in the streets of bigger cities.
        Do not carry valuables with you, and if you store them somewhere make sure they are locked away.

          For those of you with more time (and money), we recommend traveling to <a class="link" href="https://goo.gl/maps/HV4a1aP3MNjA1QvB7">Yasuní National Park</a> deep in the Ecuadorian Amazon and witness this spectacular and remote gem.

          Swim with sea lions, snorkel with penguins, and observe giant tortoises, blue-footed boobies, and marine iguanas in their natural habitats.
          It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience that should not be missed.
